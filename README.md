### MWProCapture Reversal Project

## Obtaining a distrubution
Magewell *curretly* offers a catalog of all their drivers which can be found on their website: https://www.magewell.com/downloads/pro-capture#/driver/windows

Incase of the event where the distrubtion of version `V1.3.0.4323` is no longer available to public use, it's been archived on archive.org:
https://archive.org/details/mwpro-capture-win-10-4323

The Linux distrubtion has also been archived for version `V1.3.0.4390` onto archive.org: https://archive.org/details/pro-capture-for-linux-4390.tar. These drivers can be used for reversal of the Linux Kernel Module **open-source** drivers.

As a side note; incase you're unable to find firmware on the Magewell official site for version `1.34`, please refer to the archive.org upload: https://archive.org/details/procapturehardware1.34_202411

Please do note that the archive licensing is soley reserved to Magewell.

## Tools & Notes
To look at the work I've done you **must** own the latest distrubtion of Binary Ninja or IDA 9.0 rc1.

Ideally all code for this project will be written and interpreted as: x86_64ASM, Rust, C, Verilog. I highly recommend learning all of these resources before delving into this guide.
